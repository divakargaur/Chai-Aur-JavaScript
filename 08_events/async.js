/*
JavaScript (Default Behavior)
----------
-> It is a synchronous language
-> It is a single threaded language


Execution Content
-----------------
-> Executes one line of code at a time
-> Each operation waits for the last one to complete before executing


Blocking Code
-------------
-> Block the flow of program
-> Read file synchronous


Non Blocking Code
-----------------
-> Does not block execution
-> Read file asynchronous
